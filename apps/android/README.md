# Mural for Android

Scope: existing upstream-compatible native implementation, not a LiveKit-migrated release.
The [accepted plan](../../docs/web-ios-model-gateway-plan.md) schedules LiveKit Android SDK and
the shared Mural session protocol after iOS Phase 6. Eight retained language modules are not eight
currently approved product languages. Current development/testing is English-only; Mandarin and
Cantonese remain deferred. Native compatibility and local archives are preserved.

Native Kotlin and Jetpack Compose client for Android 8.0 or later. It offers voice and written conversation, eight learning languages, 24 themes, meanings, vocabulary and local history, using the owner's OpenAI API key. Mandarin captions link each word and show optional pinyin on Android 10 or later; Android 8 and 9 keep word links without pinyin.

Word taps in all eight languages open a contextual meaning sheet, matching the iOS flow. Mandarin uses a bundled offline phrase dictionary with an ICU fallback; unresolved common ambiguous readings retain their source characters.

Interface copy lives in `res/values` (English) and `res/values-es` (Spanish); Android picks the translation from the phone's language.

See [install and build](../../docs/run-on-android.md), [design](../../docs/android/design.md) and [verification](../../verification/android-validation.md).

```sh
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest :app:lintDebug :app:assembleDebug
```

Requirements: Java 17, Android SDK 36 and Build Tools 35.0.0. The API key is entered inside the app and must never be configured in Gradle. `local.properties`, private signing keys and build outputs are excluded from Git.
