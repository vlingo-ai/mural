# Hosted startup recovery — 14 September 2026

<!-- baseline-scope:2026-09-23 -->
> 历史/版本限定验证：仅证明所列源码、平台和环境。upstream 的服务、账户、真机与商店状态不能归属于本 fork；原生 WebRTC 通过不等于新三端 LiveKit 验收。

The reviewer saw 100 minutes but could not start a conversation. An earlier unconfirmed create retained a ten-minute reservation and blocked subsequent attempts. The previous adapter discarded the provider response details, so the original startup failure cannot be established retrospectively.

Bounded synthetic checks passed with the authorized server key: direct WebRTC creation, creation from the deployed server, the complete public guest/session/close flow, and acceptance of an actual native Android SDP offer. The connected silent sessions finalized at 19 seconds. The native offer was accepted and immediately hung up without connecting client media. The emulator was shut down after the isolated diagnostic; reviewer and owner app data were preserved.

The fix distinguishes definite startup rejections from uncertain outcomes, records limited diagnostics, and provides an audited operator recovery that keeps unknown provider liability. The integrated API suite passed 319 tests with zero skips against PostgreSQL. TypeScript checking passed. No Android application source or sealed version 4 artifact changed.

Backend commit 2958a48419c9f16a12df33e8fb86e3f78f2c983f was deployed with grant budgets preserved and paid access disabled. The reviewer hold was recovered without deducting minutes; its unknown provider liability remains recorded. Two subsequent Android conversations started and settled successfully, including a typed Spanish reply, a Spanish correction and English meaning. No pending reviewer reservation remained. A production rejected-start test also confirmed unchanged balance and no unresolved session.

After explicit approval of the full ten-change bundle, Google Play confirmed version 4 and the accompanying release declarations are in review. Purchases remain disabled. The prior failure has not been relabeled as a confirmed rejection.
